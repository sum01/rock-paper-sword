# Rock Paper Sword

A simple and familiar game, except you have hit points.

Both the player and enemy start with 10 hp.\
Shield bash can absorb both sword and shield bash damage.\
Fireball ignores shield absorbs.\
The enemy randomly chooses attacks.

I'll hopefully get around to making this a simple Qt5 program in the future.

## Building

No dependencies, just the normal Cmake build process and a C++11 compatible compiler.

Unix example:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
